### **Project Overview: FPV RC Plane Simulator**

This document outlines the core concepts for a 3D FPV (First-Person View) RC plane simulator built with **Three.js**. The primary goal is to create a realistic and engaging practice tool for flying FPV remote-controlled aircraft. The simulator will feature a dynamic physics environment with adjustable parameters, a standard FPV heads-up display (HUD), and a simple, expandable world.

#### **Core Features:**

* **Realistic Flight Physics:** The simulation will model key aerodynamic forces, including thrust, lift, drag, and the effects of gravity and wind.
* **Adjustable Environment:** You will be able to modify parameters such as **gravity**, **wind speed/direction**, and the plane's **drag coefficient** to create different flying conditions and challenges.
* **FPV HUD:** The in-game view will include a Heads-Up Display showing critical flight information similar to a real FPV setup, such as an **artificial horizon**, **altitude**, **speed**, and **throttle level**.
* **Simple 3D Environment:** The initial version will feature a basic landscape with a grass field and scattered trees to practice maneuvering and depth perception.
* **Technology Stack:** The project will be developed using **Three.js**, a cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

### **Step-by-Step Development Plan**

This plan breaks down the project into manageable phases. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a clear path from a blank canvas to a functional simulator.

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Scene**

1.  **Set Up the Environment:**
    * Create a project folder.
    * Set up a basic `index.html` file to serve as the entry point for the application.
    * Include the Three.js library. You can use a CDN for simplicity or install it via npm if you're using a bundler like Vite or Webpack.
2.  **Initialize the Core Components:**
    * In a `main.js` file, create the fundamental Three.js elements:
        * `Scene`: The container for all your objects.
        * `PerspectiveCamera`: Your virtual eye in the 3D world.
        * `WebGLRenderer`: This does the magic of drawing your scene onto the HTML canvas.
    * Add basic lighting, like an `AmbientLight` for general illumination and a `DirectionalLight` to simulate the sun and create shadows.
3.  **Create a Simple World:**
    * Add a large `PlaneGeometry` with a green `MeshBasicMaterial` to serve as the ground.
    * Create a "sky" by making the scene's background a sky-blue color.
    * Implement an animation loop (`requestAnimationFrame`) to continuously render the scene.

#### **Phase 2: The RC Plane & Basic Controls**

1.  **Create or Import a Plane Model:**
    * For simplicity, start with a placeholder model using `BoxGeometry` or `ConeGeometry` to represent the plane's body and wings.
    * Later, you can import a proper 3D model (in `gltf` or `glb` format) using the `GLTFLoader`.
2.  **Implement Player Controls:**
    * Listen for keyboard events (`keydown` and `keyup`).
    * Map keys (e.g., W/S for throttle, Arrow Keys or A/D for roll, and Up/Down arrows for pitch) to control variables. Don't move the plane directly yet; these inputs will later be used to apply forces.
3.  **Set up the FPV Camera:**
    * Position the camera slightly in front of or inside your plane model.
    * Group the camera with the plane mesh so that it inherits the plane's movements and rotations, creating the FPV experience.

#### **Phase 3: Physics Simulation**

This is the most critical phase for creating a realistic feel.

1.  **Integrate a Physics Library:**
    * Choose a JavaScript 3D physics library like **Cannon-es** (a maintained fork of Cannon.js) or **Rapier**. We'll use Cannon-es for this example.
    * In your `main.js`, set up a Cannon-es `World` and configure its gravity.
2.  **Create Physics Bodies:**
    * Create a `Body` in Cannon-es for your plane. A simple `Box` shape corresponding to your placeholder model is a good start.
    * In your animation loop, update the Three.js mesh's position and rotation with the data from the Cannon-es physics body on each frame.
3.  **Simulate Flight Forces:**
    * **Thrust:** Based on the throttle input (W/S keys), apply a forward force to the plane's body using `body.applyLocalForce()`.
    * **Lift & Drag:** This is the tricky part. You'll need to approximate aerodynamics. A simple approach is:
        * **Lift:** Calculate the plane's velocity and angle of attack. Apply an upward force that increases with speed.
        * **Drag:** Apply a force that opposes the plane's velocity. This force should increase quadratically with velocity ($$F_{drag} \propto v^2$$).
    * **Control Surfaces (Roll & Pitch):** Use your control inputs to apply torque (rotational force) to the plane's body using `body.applyLocalTorque()`. For example, pressing the "roll right" key applies a torque that makes the plane rotate along its local Z-axis.

#### **Phase 4: HUD & Environment**

1.  **Create the HUD:**
    * The simplest way to create a HUD is by using HTML and CSS elements overlaid on top of your Three.js canvas.
    * Create a `<div>` for the HUD and style it with CSS.
    * Add elements for:
        * **Artificial Horizon:** This can be a graphical element that rotates based on the plane's roll and pitch.
        * **Text Readouts:** Display `speed`, `altitude`, and `throttle` by updating the text content of HTML elements from your physics simulation variables in the animation loop.
2.  **Build the Environment:**
    * Create simple tree models using `CylinderGeometry` for the trunk and `ConeGeometry` for the leaves, or import a tree model.
    * Randomly place multiple instances of these trees across your ground plane to create a simple forest to navigate. Give these trees physics bodies so you can collide with them.
3.  **Add Adjustable Parameters:**
    * Use a simple UI library like **dat.GUI**.
    * Link the GUI to your physics variables (`world.gravity.y`, custom `windSpeed`, `dragCoefficient`) to allow for real-time adjustments.
